Enabling robots to adapt to unfamiliar environments as readily as humans remains a moonshot goal of embodied AI. No finite collection of demonstrations can cover every task and situation a robot will encounter, making the ability to learn from context at deployment essential for generalization. Such in-context learning (ICL), however, remains largely beyond the reach of existing robotic policies. The broad agentic capabilities of commercial vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-6 Astra, raise a compelling question: can these models learn from demonstrations, examples, and interaction feedback, then translate that information into executable and verifiable robot behavior from a new initial state without gradient updates or persistent changes to task-specific parameters? We introduce GPT-Policy, a general-agent framework for in-context robot learning. GPT-Policy integrates a context compiler that preserves task-relevant visual transitions, a VLM that proposes robot-tool actions, and a constrained controller that verifies and executes each action and reports its outcome. We evaluate its reliability and limitations through task success and eficiency metrics, matched comparisons across models, and controlled context ablations. In real-robot trials, human video demonstrations improve task completion even without robot action labels, while aligned action references yield further gains on contact-sensitive tasks. These findings position GPT-Policy as a step toward robot adaptation through in-context learning, providing an empirical foundation for translating the general-purpose capabilities of VLMs into physical behavior and clarifying the challenges that must be overcome for reliable deployment.

## 1 Introduction

No training dataset can cover every situation a robot will encounter. Adapting to new tasks, unfamiliar object arrangements, and unexpected interactions during deployment is therefore a central challenge for embodied AI (Brohan et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; Octo Model Team et al., 2024; Black et al., 2025). Humans routinely adapt to such situations by observing others, interpreting examples, and learning from the consequences of their actions. Enabling robots to learn in this way through in-context learning (ICL) is a key step toward general embodied agents (Duan et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2024; Vosylius and Johns, 2024). General-purpose language and vision-language models (VLMs) ofer a promising starting point: their ability to learn from context suggests that some capabilities needed for robot adaptation may already be present without dedicated policy training (Brown et al., 2020; Alayrac et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022). This raises a central question: to what extent can these models use contextual information to guide robot behavior in unfamiliar situations?

We define robotic ICL as the ability to adapt behavior based on demonstrations, examples, or interaction experience provided at test time, without gradient updates or persistent task-specific parameter changes. This requires a robot to extract relevant information from context and apply it to its current situation, even when that situation difers from the demonstrations. Each form of context can guide a diferent aspect of behavior: goal images specify desired outcomes, human and robot videos illustrate procedures, and aligned robot actions provide motion references. Interaction history records previous observations and outcomes, while online human feedback clarifies intent or changes in environmental rules. The central challenge is to

## In-Context Learning for Robots

Learn from demonstrations, examples, interactions, and history, then generalize to new tasks.

Figure 1 In-context robot control with GPT-Policy. A general-purpose VLM combines the task instruction, initial state, and contextual information to guide robot actions. Context can include human videos, robot videos with recorded actions, goal images, human–robot interaction, and self-interaction history. The examples illustrate manipulation, interactive play, and mobile object retrieval.

determine which information matters for the current decision and translate it into appropriate physical action.

Recent robot foundation models have begun to demonstrate this capability. GEN-1.5 reports one-shot skill adaptation from physical prompts, including human-to-robot and sim-to-real examples (Generalist Team, 2026). S1 uses video demonstrations to specify novel atomic and long-horizon tasks (Skild AI, 2026), while Zero-WAM trains a video-action model to follow human video guidance on unseen tasks (Zhou et al., 2026). These advances motivate a complementary question: to what extent can of-the-shelf, general-purpose VLMs support robotic in-context learning without being trained as dedicated robot policies? Answering this question can help distinguish the task understanding available in general models from the capabilities that require specialized embodied learning.

To investigate this question, we introduce GPT-Policy, a general-agent framework that connects an of-theshelf VLM to robot tools through a shared closed-loop interface. A context compiler preserves task-relevant visual transitions and available action references. The VLM interprets this context alongside the current scene and proposes parameterized robot-tool actions. A constrained execution layer checks and executes the proposed actions, then returns observations and outcomes to support replanning. This interface allows us to examine how diferent models use diferent forms of context within a common execution framework.

Our evaluation covers five context families spanning cross-embodiment imitation, contact-sensitive manipulation, goal-image following, active exploration, and human-robot interaction. Through matched model comparisons and controlled context ablations, we measure whether context improves task completion and how it changes decision count and execution time. The results show that task-relevant context can improve success while reducing decisions and execution time. In real-robot trials, human videos improve task completion even without robot action labels, while aligned action references provide further gains on contact-sensitive tasks. Yet the same experiments expose a consequential gap: better task understanding and action selection do not ensure precise contact, reliable outcome verification, or physical safety. Context can guide a robot toward the right behavior while leaving critical execution failures unresolved.

These findings make robotic ICL a concrete question about where adaptation succeeds and where it breaks down across the perception–action loop. General-purpose VLMs can already use heterogeneous context to inform robot decisions, providing a starting point for adaptation beyond the training distribution. The next challenge is to make that adaptability dependable throughout physical execution. By providing a common framework and empirical evidence for studying this gap, GPT-Policy helps define a research agenda for embodied foundation models and identifies several promising directions for near-term research.

## 2 Related Work

General-purpose agents for robot control. Recent general-purpose models, including GPT-6 Astra, Claude Fable, Kimi K3, and GLM-5.3, support reasoning, tool use, and multi-step task execution (OpenAI, 2026; Anthropic, 2026; Kimi Team, 2026; Z.ai, 2026). In robotics, language and vision–language models have been applied to afordance-grounded skill selection (Ahn et al., 2022), program synthesis over perception and control APIs (Liang et al., 2023), and spatial objective construction for motion planning (Huang et al., 2023). Agentic systems further automate policy development through execution feedback: ASPIRE diagnoses program failures and distills validated repairs into reusable skills (Lu et al., 2026), while ENPIRE enables coding agents to refine robot policies and training procedures through repeated real-world trials (Xiao et al., 2026). Closer to online action selection, RoboPrompt predicts robot actions from textual prompts encoding object poses and expert end-efector actions (Yin et al., 2025). Show-Harness enables closed-loop VLM control through a discrete semantic action interface and uses video demonstrations to condition task planning (Chen et al., 2026). Our study focuses on how context shapes the embodied behavior of a general-purpose agent.

In-context learning for robot policies. Demonstration-conditioned robot control builds on in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) and one-shot imitation (Duan et al., 2017), using examples provided at deployment to specify the desired behavior. Existing policies extract task information from robot sensorimotor trajectories (Fu et al., 2024; Sridhar et al., 2025; Generalist Team, 2026) or geometric demonstration representations (Vosylius and Johns, 2024). This paradigm also accommodates human visual demonstrations, allowing observed human behavior to guide robot execution (Shah et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2026; Zhou et al., 2026; Skild AI, 2026). Beyond individual demonstrations, RoboTTT investigates adaptation from long visual contexts that combine human demonstrations with robot interaction history (Jiang et al., 2026). Despite diferences in context representation and adaptation mechanism, these works share a focus on enabling robot policies and embodied foundation models to exploit demonstration context. Our study instead examines this capability in an of-the-shelf general-purpose multimodal agent: how visual demonstrations and interaction history inform its task interpretation and action selection, without additional robot-specific training or test-time parameter updates.

## 3 Method

GPT-Policy connects a general-purpose vision-language model (VLM) to robot tools through a shared contextto-action interface (Figure 2). Embodiment-specific adapters translate tool requests into executable commands. We describe the task formulation, context construction, and closed-loop execution below.

## 3.1 Problem Formulation

Let T denote the task instruction and $o _ { t } = ( I _ { t } , s _ { t } )$ the latest observation, where $I _ { t }$ comprises images labeled by camera view and $s _ { t }$ denotes the robot state. The context $c _ { t }$ contains the task references and online interaction history available at decision step t. Depending on the context condition, it includes a goal image $G ,$ , demonstration videos V represented by selected keyframes, recorded action sequences A with any accompanying measured robot states, and online interaction history $H _ { t }$ . System instructions define the embodiment, coordinate conventions, and tool schemas.

![](images/e76252ce876fc11f7ba83c77456b69c3063508d48fb87c1f6944bfcc4add00ea.jpg)  
Figure 2 Overall architecture of GPT-Policy. The task instruction, current state, task references, and interaction history are combined with shared instructions and tool schemas to form the VLM input. A fixed VLM selects tool requests, which constrained robot tools execute. Returned observations and execution feedback update the context for the nex decision. The images illustrate inputs from diferent experimental conditions.

At step t, the model selects a tool request $a _ { t } ~ = ~ ( u _ { t } , v _ { t } )$ , comprising a tool name $u _ { t }$ and arguments $v _ { t } ,$ conditioned on $T , c _ { t } , o _ { t } .$ , and the preceding tool result $f _ { t - 1 } { \mathrm { : } }$

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { a _ { t } \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( { } \cdot { } | T , c _ { t } , o _ { t } , f _ { t - 1 } ) , } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { ( o _ { t + 1 } , f _ { t } ) = \mathcal E ( a _ { t } , o _ { t } ) . } } \end{array}\tag{1}
$$

Here, $\pi _ { \theta }$ is the VLM policy, whose parameters θ remain fixed during task execution, and $\mathcal { E }$ is the robot-tool interface. The result $f _ { t }$ contains returned information, execution progress, or errors. After a completed or rejected request, the next decision receives updated observations and the preceding tool result. No preceding tool result is available at the first decision.

## 3.2 Context Construction

Task references. Task references specify a desired outcome or illustrate a procedure. A ⟨goal image G⟩ provides a visual reference for the target object arrangement or task outcome without prescribing intermediate actions. ⟨Demonstration videos V⟩ show object interactions and action order in human demonstrations, where a person performs the task, or teleoperated robot demonstrations, where a human operator controls the robot. ⟨Recorded actions A⟩ optionally supplement these videos and may include accompanying measured robot states. These reference records remain distinct from the model’s tool requests $a _ { t }$ in the current trial.

For model input, V is encoded as timestamp-ordered frames paired with viewpoint identifiers, available annotations, and corresponding state or action records. The loader interleaves these text records with image blocks. Because annotations may describe the procedure, comparisons of recorded-action inputs must hold the selected images and non-action text fixed and specify the state information provided.

Online interaction history. During execution, $H _ { t }$ records observations, tool requests, results, and operator feedback separately from the task references. Provider adapters manage this history by retaining reference inputs, limiting older live images, and either retaining accumulated text or replacing older exchanges with host-generated summaries. These updates preserve the ongoing robot trial and decision count.

Figure 3 Details of the GPT-Policy execution harness. (a) The VLM policy $\pi \theta$ generates tool requests from interleaved image and text inputs; selected arguments are shown schematically. (b) The Cartesian adapter resolves targets, samples the pose path, checks IK residuals, times joint references, and executes the motion. Cartesian moves hold gripper commands; separate tools change the gripper opening. Solid arrows trace the forward path; dashed arrows return observations and execution or rejection feedback for the next decision.

## 3.3 Model Interface and Closed-Loop Execution

Figure 3 traces the closed loop from VLM tool requests to robot execution and feedback. The Cartesian adapter samples the requested pose path, solves inverse kinematics (IK), and assigns timestamps to the joint references. Robot observations and execution feedback inform the next VLM decision.

Structured tool interface. Inputs to $\pi _ { \theta }$ interleave source- and view-labeled image blocks with text records for $T , c _ { t } , o _ { t }$ , and $f _ { t - 1 }$ , together with system instructions and tool schemas. Provider adapters normalize a structured JSON selection or native tool call into name $\left( { { u } _ { t } } \right)$ and an arguments object $\left( v _ { t } \right)$ . Figure 3 illustrates the selected arguments of a motion request, including a note describing the observed cue and intended action. Appendix D provides the prompt templates, context formats, and representative task instructions.

Cartesian requests specify one target (move\_to) or an ordered sequence (move\_eef\_chunk) for the tool center point (TCP), a calibrated reference frame on the end efector. Each non-null target contains its position $p \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 }$ and orientation $R \in S O ( 3 )$ as pose\_xyzquat, using the arm’s base frame and xyzw quaternion order. In bimanual requests, a null arm entry holds its preceding pose. Gripper commands remain fixed during Cartesian motion and change through set\_gripper.

Pose interpolation. Starting from $( p _ { 0 } , R _ { 0 } )$ , the adapter connects successive targets $( p _ { j } , R _ { j } ) , j = 1 , \ldots , J $ using linear position interpolation and quaternion spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) along the shorter rotation arc (Shoemake, 1985). For segment $j = 0 , \ldots , J - 1$ and progress $s \in [ 0 , 1 ]$ , the path is

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { p _ { j } ( s ) = ( 1 - s ) p _ { j } + s p _ { j + 1 } , } } \\ { { R _ { j } ( s ) = R _ { j } \exp \bigl ( s \mathrm { L o g } ( R _ { j } ^ { \top } R _ { j + 1 } ) \bigr ) . } } \end{array}\tag{2}
$$

The adapter samples this geometric path before solving IK.

Inverse kinematics. After converting each sampled TCP pose to the backend’s kinematic frame, IK computes a joint reference from the preceding solution, initialized with the measured joint configuration at

planning time:

$$
q _ { k } = \mathrm { I K } ( \widehat { p } _ { k } , \widehat { R } _ { k } ; q _ { k - 1 } ) .\tag{3}
$$

The shared residual requirements are

$$
\| e _ { p , k } \| _ { 2 } \le \epsilon _ { p } , \qquad \| e _ { R , k } \| _ { 2 } \le \epsilon _ { R } .\tag{4}
$$

Here $e _ { p , k }$ and $e _ { R , k }$ are the position and orientation residuals, and $\epsilon _ { p } , \epsilon _ { R }$ are their execution tolerances. Numerical stopping criteria and joint-bound handling depend on the IK backend; Appendix A specifies these distinctions. Sequential seeding does not impose a hard bound on the joint displacement between samples.

Execution and feedback. After IK, Ruckig (Berscheid and Kröger, 2021) assigns timestamps through a scalar progress profile. Time scaling then enforces the sampled joint velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits (Appendix A). The backend dispatches the timed joint references and reports measured state, endpoint errors, and settling status. Completed and rejected requests supply feedback for the next decision; faults or operator interruption can end the trial. Model-declared completion remains distinct from physical task success.

Configuration-specific extensions can add geometric observations, motion rejection rules, or a separate completion review that returns unverified completion requests to the control loop.

## 4 Experiments

This section evaluates whether a general-purpose agent can adapt to tasks during closed-loop robotic-arm operation by using diferent forms of context. The experiments are designed to answer three questions:

1. What information does each form of context provide?

2. Can this information improve task completion rates and reduce the number of decisions?

3. Which forms of context remain efective for fine contact-rich manipulation, deformable-object handling, and human-robot collaboration?

## 4.1 Experimental Setup

Each episode starts from a reset scene and ends when the task succeeds, the execution budget is exhausted, or a safety termination condition is triggered. An episode is counted as successful only when the final scene satisfies the task-specific geometric and semantic success criteria. All conditions use the same success criteria and termination rules. Each experiment is repeated three times.

The main metrics are:

• Success Rate (S/T): S denotes the number of successful trials and T denotes the total number of trials; the metric is reported as $S / T$

• Decisions: The number of decisions generated by the agent in one episode. Under the task-specific counting convention, each generated action target or action block counts as one decision.

• Execution Time: The total time required to complete the task.

Robot, sensing, planning, and execution configurations are summarized in Appendix B. The experimental results are summarized in Table 1.

## 4.2 In-Context Learning from Human Videos

We evaluate whether a single human demonstration video can guide GPT-6 Astra on “Pick Red Towel” and “Pick Up Notebook.” Human Video adds the video to the standard inputs; None uses the same instruction and observations without the Human Video. As shown in Table 1, Human Video achieves $2 / 3$ success on both tasks, compared with $0 / 3$ under None. For towel pickup, the average decision count decreases from 96.3 to 76.7 and average execution time from 24.6 to 18.9 minutes; for notebook pickup, the corresponding averages

decrease from 94.0 to 66.7 decisions and from 24.6 to 16.1 minutes.

The combination of higher success and lower average execution costs suggests that the demonstration provides useful procedural guidance. Figure 4 shows grasping methods and interaction sequences that may help constrain the agent’s choice of strategy. The human demonstration supplies no robot action labels; the agent generates robot-specific motion targets from current observations. These results are consistent with transferring an interaction strategy across embodiments.

## 4.3 In-Context Learning from Robot Video and Actions

We compare None (no demonstration), Robot Video, and Robot Video + Action, which adds time-aligned end-efector poses, gripper states, and action commands to the same video. “Unscrew Bottle Cap” requires leaving the opened bottle standing securely; “Remove and Reinsert Plug” requires removing the plug and reinserting it into its original socket so that it remains fully seated after gripper release. In this condition order, Table 1 reports bottle-opening success of 0/3, 2/3, and 3/3, averaging 71.0, 74.3, and 54.7 decisions and 16.1, 15.2, and 17.9 minutes. Plug-task success is 0/3, 0/3, and 2/3, averaging 24.0, 33.7, and 48.3 decisions and 5.3, 7.9, and 10.8 minutes. Action references yield the highest observed success on both tasks, but do not consistently reduce costs; these averages include failed trials.

Action references guide trajectory selection. Action references improve alignment with the demonstrated motion in the selected runs. In bottle opening (Figure 7), executions using robot video with action references more closely match the demonstration in requested orientations and measured support posture than those using video alone. We hypothesize that the denser temporal information in action references reduces ambiguity about motion between video keyframes. Table 5 reports 205 retained action samples for 13 video keyframes in bottle opening and 131 samples for 14 keyframes in plug reinsertion. Whereas sparse keyframes leave intervening motion to be inferred, action references supply intermediate commanded poses and gripper transitions that help constrain this inference.

Frames progress from left to right. Gold boxes mark reference regions in the demonstrations. Red marks local deviations; green marks closer matches.

## 4.4 In-Context Learning from Goal Images

We evaluate the Target Image condition on “Arrange T Shape” and “Arrange Fruit,” adding a single image of the desired final layout to the standard inputs. GPT-6 Astra achieves 3/3 success on both tasks (Table 1), averaging 66.7 decisions and 15.8 minutes on “Arrange T Shape” and 49.0 decisions and 12.4 minutes on “Arrange Fruit.” In preliminary qualitative comparisons, we observe closer matches to the desired layout than in runs without a target image. These cases illustrate how a single image can complement text by jointly specifying object identity, relative position, and spacing. For diferently colored blocks or diferently shaped fruits that must occupy specific locations, this visual specification conveys spatial requirements that can be

cumbersome to describe precisely in words.

## 4.5 In-Context Learning from Self-Interaction History

We evaluate “Lemon to Pink Plate” and “Movable Exploration” under Self History, which retains the agent’s earlier observations, actions, and execution outcomes within each task. GPT-6 Astra achieves 3/3 success on both tasks (Table 1), averaging 35.3 decisions and 8.1 minutes on “Lemon to Pink Plate” and 40.33 decisions and 25.53 minutes on “Movable Exploration.” Mobile exploration takes substantially longer despite similar decision counts, highlighting the distinction between decision count and elapsed time.

Surprisingly, the agent autonomously removes the towel to uncover and locate the pink plate before placing the lemon (Figure 6). During mobile exploration, it also actively avoids obstacles along its route while searching for the target. These behaviors are consistent with high-level reasoning about intermediate subgoals: changing the scene to obtain missing information and choosing a feasible route to continue the search.

## 4.6 In-Context Learning from Online Human Interaction

We evaluate “Tic-Tac-Toe” and “Pointed Fruit Pickup” under Human–Robot Interaction, where human game moves provide context for turn-taking and pointing gestures specify which fruit to select. GPT-6 Astra achieves 3/3 success on both tasks (Table 1), averaging 69.7 decisions and 13.6 minutes on “Tic-Tac-Toe” and 67.3 decisions and 15.0 minutes on “Pointed Fruit Pickup.”For ‘Tic-Tac-Toe,” both wins and draws are counted as successful task completion.

The Online interaction history described in Section 3.2 records observations, tool requests, results, and operator feedback. Alongside current observations, this record provides context for tracking what the human and robot have each done, whose turn it is, and how far the task has progressed. In the observed Tic-Tac-Toe games, the agent also selects optimal moves for the current board state, illustrating how turn coordination can be combined with strategic reasoning during human–robot interaction.warnings

## 5 Discussion

Comparison with Other Models. Table 2 and Figure 8 compare individual runs on red towel pickup. For GPT-6 Astra, human video increases task progress from 55% to 100%, with approximately 35.6% shorter run time and 58.9% lower estimated token usage. Fable 5.1 and Kimi K3 use fewer resources but reach only 30% and 20% progress, respectively. These examples do not establish a reliable model ranking. Task progress is distinct from success rate: GPT-6 Astra succeeds in 2/3 Human Video trials (Table 1).

A Little Context Goes a Long Way. VLM Agents are surprisingly good at learning on the fly. Human videos reveal how a task unfolds, while action references provide more precise motion cues. In these early trials, such context helps Agents step outside their usual comfort zone and tackle fine manipulation and deformable-object handling. Good Plans, Tricky Execution. Context can sharpen task understanding, planning, and adaptation. Still, knowing what to do is not the same as doing it reliably. Precise pose generation, contact execution, outcome verification, and physical safety remain challenges of their own.

Moves Take Time. VLM Agents can already generate useful actions, but each decision can still be slow and expensive. Specialized VLA/WAM models may therefore have an edge in fast, low-level control, while VLM Agents focus on reasoning, adaptation, and replanning.

Future Directions. These takeaways motivate six directions for future research.

Physical safety for VLM-driven manipulation. We repeatedly observed collisions between the two arms during manipulation. This motivates a dedicated safety layer that checks both arms’ planned trajectories together, monitors separation and contact during execution, and can interrupt unsafe commands independently of the VLM. Collision-aware planning and uncertainty-aware execution limits should be evaluated alongside task success, with explicit reporting of collisions, near misses, and safety interventions.

Contact-aware harnesses for reliable grasping. Building on existing execution and rejection feedback, future harnesses should expose grasp stability and object motion after contact. Slip detection, force-aware limits, and local recovery could strengthen rigid and deformable-object grasping without requiring the agent to reason through every correction.

System 1 / System 2 for fine-grained action. Hierarchical systems such as Hi Robot separate contextual reasoning from low-level execution (Shi et al., 2025). A promising extension pairs a deliberative System 2 agent with a fast System 1 controller, such as a VLA policy, for pose refinement and bimanual coordination. The key question is when local feedback should trigger replanning.

Mobile manipulation through active perception. Building on afordance-grounded skill selection (Ahn et al., 2022), a mobile agent should choose where to look and stand as well as how to grasp. Persistent spatial memory and coordinated base–arm control would support tasks in which navigation changes visibility, reachability, and the meaning of earlier observations.

Compositional context for long-horizon tasks. Trajectory prompting, as in ICRT (Fu et al., 2024), provides a starting point for treating demonstrations as structured sensorimotor context. A useful next test is whether an agent can compose subskills from multiple demonstrations in a new sequence while retaining completed subgoals and discarding obsolete context, rather than replaying an entire trajectory.

In-context adaptation to physical dynamics. Tactile-informed dynamics models (Ai et al., 2024) and videoconditioned world-action models (Zhou et al., 2026) ofer complementary starting points. Future systems could use recent interactions to update predictions of friction, compliance, and object response, then adjust actions before contact failures accumulate. This would test adaptation to changing physics, not only to a new task description.

Scope and Limitations. The current evidence covers small task series under selected platform, model, and context conditions. Incomplete ablations and unobserved pretraining limit causal and novel-skill claims. Context quality, observation–action alignment, execution latency, and human intervention remain constraints; transfer across embodiments and reliable autonomous operation require broader evaluation. The observed interarm collisions show that existing safeguards are insuficient by themselves for safe autonomous deployment.

## 6 Conclusion

We study how fixed general agents use demonstrations, goal images, and interaction experience in robotic tasks without parameter updates. GPT-Policy provides a shared context-to-action interface for examining these inputs. The recorded behaviors illustrate goal grounding, changes in operation order, and online coordination, while contact execution and outcome verification remain distinct challenges. The task-level model comparisons and reserved ablations provide a basis for testing when context improves success, eficiency, and recovery across manipulation and mobile exploration.

## Appendix

## A Method Details

This appendix details target resolution, IK residuals, and trajectory timing.

## A.1 Target Resolution and Gripper Commands

The planner initializes the TCP path by forward kinematics from measured joint positions. Each non-null target contains a complete pose $\mathbf { \bar { \Sigma } } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \mathbf { \Sigma } \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \mathbf { \Sigma } \Sigma \Sigma \mathbf { } \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \mathbf { } \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \mathbf \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma \Sigma$ in the selected arm’s base frame, with position in metres. Finite, nonzero quaternions are normalized. In a bimanual sequence, a null entry repeats that arm’s preceding complete pose; an arm whose entries are all null receives no new trajectory. Individual coordinates are not filled independently. Calibrated transforms convert TCP targets into the end-efector frame used by IK.

Cartesian trajectories retain the existing gripper command throughout. A separate set\_gripper request changes the opening, using a normalized value in [0, 1] (closed to open); bimanual requests use positions.left/right. Commands and measured openings remain distinct.

## A.2 IK Residuals and Backend Checks

For a target $( \widehat { p } _ { k } , \widehat { R } _ { k } )$ and forward kinematics $( p ( q _ { k } ) , R ( q _ { k } ) )$ at the same solver-facing end-efector frame, define

$$
\begin{array} { r } { e _ { p , k } = p ( q _ { k } ) - \widehat { p } _ { k } , \qquad e _ { R , k } = \mathrm { L o g } \Big ( \widehat { R } _ { k } ^ { \top } R ( q _ { k } ) \Big ) ^ { \vee } . } \end{array}\tag{5}
$$

Here $( \cdot ) ^ { \vee }$ converts a skew-symmetric matrix to a rotation vector; the orientation norm is the relative rotation angle. Residuals are checked after the TCP-to-kinematic-frame conversion. The execution tolerances in Eq. (4) are 0.002 m and approximately 1<sup>◦</sup>, while the numerical stopping tolerances are $1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ m and $5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ rad.

ARX uses SDK IK followed by damped least-squares refinement, with joint bounds supplied to the solver and used to clip refinement updates. Its final acceptance test checks pose residuals. YAM uses I2RT kinematics and additionally checks the finite solution against efective SDK joint bounds. Neither adapter requires the solver’s convergence flag when the execution checks pass. Sequential seeding starts from measured joints and imposes no separate hard inter-sample joint-step bound. Morphi Kino uses native numerical IK with analytic fallback and execution residual thresholds of 0.003 m and 0.02 rad. Before motion, it checks finite solutions, native joint bounds, and inter-sample joint changes below 0.15 rad. Joint velocities respect URDF limits and a 0.2 rad/s cap.

## A.3 Timing, Synchronization, and Feedback

Each Cartesian segment is sampled using the configured motion limits; nearly coincident orientations use normalized linear interpolation. For moving segments, Ruckig (Berscheid and Kröger, 2021) assigns timestamps through a scalar progress profile with zero endpoint velocity and acceleration. Successive finite diferences on the timed joint samples estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk. Let $r _ { v } , r _ { a } , r _ { j }$ be their largest absolute derivative-to-limit ratios over all samples and joints. Time is stretched by

$$
\alpha _ { 0 } = \operatorname* { m a x } \{ 1 , r _ { v } , \sqrt { r _ { a } } , \sqrt [ 3 ] { r _ { j } } \} , \qquad \alpha = \left\{ { 1 , \qquad \alpha _ { 0 } = 1 , \qquad \tau _ { k } ^ { \prime } = \alpha \tau _ { k } } \right. .\tag{6}
$$

Joint samples are unchanged; the computed derivatives scale by $\alpha ^ { - 1 } , \alpha ^ { - 2 }$ , and $\alpha ^ { - 3 }$ . This checks the sampled reference, not continuous-time physical jerk.

Both arms are planned before submission. Corresponding segments are synchronized to the longer duration by slowing the faster trajectory. ARX submits timestamped references; YAM interpolates the timed joint references for 100 Hz streaming. Both append a final hold and report measured settling separately. IK

rejection returns feedback before submission. The planner does not check collisions, and reference acceptance or measured settling does not establish task success.

## B Robot Configurations

Table 3 summarizes the principal robot, sensing, planning, and execution settings in the YAM, ARX X5, and Morphi Kino implementations inspected. These are source-configuration defaults; individual runs may override them. YAM and ARX X5 each use two six-joint arms and top, left-wrist, and right-wrist RGB views. Morphi Kino uses two seven-joint arms and head, chest, left-wrist, and right-wrist RGB views, together with a mobile base, articulated waist, and head. Camera and TCP conventions are installation-specific.

Table 3 Robot, motion, and execution configurations. Planning limits apply to the generated reference. Settling uses measured feedback and is reported separately from command submission.

Here $V _ { i } ^ { \mathrm { S D K } }$ denotes the initialized ARX SDK velocity limit for joint i, and $V _ { i } ^ { \mathrm { U R D F } }$ denotes the Morphi Kino URDF velocity limit. YAM directly uses 0.6 rad $\mathrm { \nabla \cdot } / \mathrm { s } ;$ its adapter does not apply the velocity-scale field also present in the JSON profile. YAM and ARX X5 gripper widths are nominal conversions of normalized readings. Morphi Kino exposes normalized aperture without a configured metric opening-width conversion.

Morphi Kino represents orientation using six dimensionless rotation-matrix components (rot6d). Its component sampling budget therefore is not an angular increment in radians. At the default 10 Hz reference rate, the XYZ component budget implies 0.03 m/s per coordinate, rather than a 0.03 $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s }$ Euclidean TCP speed limit. Its Ruckig configuration shapes reference timing; it does not impose explicit joint acceleration or jerk limits after IK. Adaptive IK sampling retains the complete reference and validates interpolated candidates before motion. Joint-rate scaling can extend execution time, with both reference duration and actual playback separately capped at 30 s.

Morphi Kino evaluates arm arrival using the final measured joint errors after its 1 s hold. A stable miss within the 0.08 rad tracking guard can return target\_incomplete for policy assessment. The span criterion applies to these incomplete results; the arrival test does not independently require a measured-speed threshold or distinct timestamped samples. Gripper completion is assessed separately. Fresh healthy IDLE feedback and stop confirmation are required before execution completion is accepted.

A settling timeout in YAM or ARX X5 is reported as an unsettled result. Collision checking is not part of the Cartesian planner; runtime diagnostics and provider-specific checks do not establish collision-free motion or physical task success.

Provider-dependent behavior. Codex refreshes retain reference content and accumulated text while omitting older live images. The ARX Claude Messages adapter pins the initial input, limits recent live images, and summarizes older exchanges. Its execution wrapper additionally supplies TCP geometry, applies motion rejection rules, and reviews completion in a separate model session, returning unverified completion requests to the control loop. The inspected YAM branch omits these additional execution and review procedures.

Morphi Kino uses the generic agent policy with embodiment-specific tool wrappers and native execution checks. These validate IK residuals, joint bounds, continuity, velocity, feedback freshness, tracking, and stopping, and return eligible rejections or incomplete outcomes with fresh observations for replanning. Its current task input uses four RGB views without depth. Model-reported completion and native execution receipts remain distinct from independently verified physical task success.

## C Demonstration Data Details

## C.1 Reference Sources and Collection Protocol

Human demonstrations. We record a person performing the task in a first- or third-person RGB video. Selected frames show the approach, object interaction, and outcome, without numerical robot states or actions (Table 4).

Table 4 Human demonstration examples. Each reference uses one view; time is relative to the video start. Remove Glue Cap is an additional reference task beyond the main comparison.

Teleoperated robot demonstrations. During teleoperation, we record timestamped images, measured joint and end-efector states, and motion and gripper commands. Unscrew Bottle Cap uses an overhead view; Remove and Reinsert Plug adds two wrist views. Recording covers the full manipulation through release and withdrawal, preserving both the action sequence and visible outcome.

Goal images. We obtain goal images as overhead-view screenshots or photographs taken by an operator. Each image shows the desired object arrangement and is supplied with the task instruction and live observations. It specifies object identities, relative positions, and spacing, without prescribing an action sequence or providing recorded robot states.

## C.2 Robot Demonstration Content

A keyframe denotes one selected time and can contain multiple camera views (Table 5). Video and Video + Action share the selected images; only the latter includes measured states and recorded action segments. No-demonstration inputs omit the reference.

Table 5 Robot demonstration content by input mode. Images include all views; states/segments count keyframes with measured state/action intervals. Samples are reference records before/after context sampling, not policy decisions.

## C.3 Keyframe Selection and Input Representation

For automatic keyframe selection, a vision model selects key moments from candidate frames in overlapping video windows. Global review removes redundant holds while retaining initial and final states, contact, release, and arm-role changes. The reference contains at most 24 keyframes and 48 images, resized to fit within 1,280 pixels per dimension without upscaling. Input interleaves chronological images with relative times, camera labels, and available stage annotations. Reference boundaries distinguish demonstrations from live observations; Video + Action additionally includes aligned numerical records.

## C.4 State-Action Alignment and Sampling

We align camera images with measured joint and end-efector states, gripper openings, and issued commands on a shared timestamp axis. Each keyframe uses the nearest state within 0.1 s; additional camera views are matched to the overhead image within the same tolerance. Missing measurements remain absent. This is timestamp matching, not hardware-synchronized exposure.

At successive selected video times $t _ { i }$ and $t _ { i + 1 }$ , the image at $t _ { i }$ is paired with its measured state and the action segment leading to $t _ { i + 1 }$ . For plug removal, this links the grasp image and gripper state to the subsequent withdrawal commands. We retain segment endpoints, approximately one action sample per second, and both sides of gripper-command changes. Commands remain distinct from measured feedback. These records guide Video + Action reasoning, not direct trajectory replay.

## D Prompt Details

This appendix presents controller instructions, context formats, and representative task prompts. Instructions are grouped by function, with implementation-specific identifiers abstracted and paragraph breaks added for readability. Angle brackets mark variable inputs; numerical demonstration excerpts are historical records, not executable targets.

Table 6 summarizes the instruction templates (P0–P4). The F-series listings illustrate context and tool formats.

## P0a Select demonstration keyframes

[BEFORE CONTROL / LOCAL VIDEO WINDOW]

[Selection objective]

Select demonstration keyframes from the supplied chronological video window and candidate images. For the current task, select the smallest set that conveys the initial state, key actions, state changes, and final outcome. Preserve before/after evidence for grasping, release, and handoffs, and the order of repeated twists. Similar start/end poses do not imply no motion.

[Multi-view evidence]

Candidates may contain multiple camera views. Combine wrist close-ups with the top overview; do not rely on an occluded top view alone. Record contact side, object-to-gripper orientation, gripper-to-table direction, and distinctions such as empty-gripper recontact after release.

[Annotations and output]

Use short stage names. Left/right annotations describe robot or human hand roles; stabilizing an object is an important action. State only image-supported outcomes, including uncertainty or occlusion; gripper closure alone does not prove a grasp. Explain each selected frame’s visual evidence. Do not invent unfamiliar objects or actions.

Cover the window’s beginning and end with minimal redundant imagery. Select only supplied candidate indices and return chronological order. You have no shell, file, or robot-control tools. Return only JSON matching the supplied output schema.

## P0b Review the complete demonstration

## [BEFORE CONTROL / GLOBAL KEYFRAME REVIEW]

[Review the images]

Review the full historical demonstration before robot execution and return a concise, complete keyframe set. Inputs are preliminary images and annotations selected per window, not yet globally deduplicated. Verify the images; do not blindly trust local annotations.

Each time may include top, left-wrist, and right-wrist views. Use wrist close-ups to identify contact side, grasp direction, object-to-gripper orientation, gripper-to-table direction, and recontact after release. Record these relationships in phase annotations; do not mislabel empty-gripper pressing as regrasping.

[Preserve the manipulation sequence]

Usually retain 12–16 frames, never exceeding the supplied limit. Merge redundant holds and window boundaries while preserving the initial state, preparation, contact, grasp verification, arm-role changes, release, and final outcome. Select important before/after changes separately; the host will not add neighboring images automatically. Preserve the order of repeated twists and regrasps rather than describing them as no motion.

[Return evidence-grounded annotations]

The summary covers the full operation and uncertain phases; stage is a short label; left/right describe roles; reason gives visual evidence; result states only visible outcomes. Explicitly report when success cannot be verified.

Retain the full sequence’s first and last frames and return chronological order. Historical actions are references, not pending commands. You have no robot or file tools.

## P1 Shared controller contract

## [SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS]

[Robot state and coordinate frames]

Control the robot using absolute calibrated TCP targets, not joint-angle commands. Joint positions and velocities are measured feedback in radians and radians per second. Do not convert joint values to degrees or reinterpret encoder values as a different joint mode. The host seeds IK with live joint positions.

Each arm has its own base frame: +x forward, +y left, +z up. Reported and commanded TCP poses use that arm’s frame. Use the calibrated grasp reference; do not substitute a different fingertip or flange origin. Tool +z points from wrist to fingertips; tool +y is the jaw opening axis.

## P1 Shared controller contract (continued)

```ini
[Pose representation]
The reported pose_xyzrpy=[x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw] is an absolute TCP pose in metres and radians. Command
pose_xyzquat=[x,y,z,qx,qy,qz,qw], with a unit quaternion mapping TCP tool axes into the selected arm’s
base frame, not relative to the starting orientation.
For example, xyzw=[1,0,0,0] points tool +z along base -z and tool +x along base +x. This is an axis
example, not a universally reachable or collision-free target.
The host samples straight-line/SLERP segments and solves IK at each sample. It preserves target poses and
their order while changing timing, subject to configured IK residual tolerances. Bimanual arrival times
are synchronized by slowing the faster arm. A null side holds its previously submitted TCP and gripper
targets.
[Camera views and geometric evidence]
Left and right RGB cameras move with the corresponding wrists; the top RGB camera is fixed above the
workspace. Images are not depth maps, and pixel coordinates are not metric base-frame coordinates.
Geometric queries use stored camera intrinsics and extrinsics. Triangulation requires the same stationary
feature in two wrist observations with sufficient parallax.
[One response per decision]
Return exactly one tool selection:
{"name": "<tool name>", "arguments": <tool arguments>}
No Markdown or text outside this object. Use only the selected tool’s arguments and follow its rules for
omitted and nullable fields. Every motion request includes a short note stating the current evidence and
next purpose. Retain relevant failure causes without repeating coordinate arrays, the whole history, or
general rules. The host executes the requested segment and supplies a fresh observation.
```

## P2 Interpret historical demonstrations

[REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS]

Available recorded state/action fields are included. Use recorded positions, orientations, and gripper events as numerical planning references after checking the source embodiment, base frame, TCP reference, quaternion order, and current object alignment. Use a matching stage’s orientation to reason about tool axes; do not discard numerical orientation evidence and imitate only the object’s apparent direction. Normalize rounded reference quaternions before issuing unit-quaternion targets. Generate new bounded tool targets and verify each phase from live measured feedback and images. Commanded poses are not measured poses; missing fields are unknown, not zero. Do not stream old absolute joint commands. [Return to the live scene] END HISTORICAL DEMONSTRATION. Use the current task and live observations below.

## D.2 Context Formats

F1 is shared by all conditions. F2–F5 add the selected reference or interaction context; the no-demonstration condition omits ofline references. Image placeholders denote actual image blocks. The listings expose field structure and content order; variable-length arrays and tool-dependent fields remain parameterized. Table 7 summarizes the role of each format.

]   
}   
[How to read the records]   
Each row follows the header’s column order. In joint, pose, and gripper columns, "=" repeats the   
preceding row’s value within the same interval; the first row is explicit. Null means missing, never   
zero. Joint and pose arrays retain their original order. The target pose uses metres and quaternion   
xyzw.   
Keyframe geometry is measured feedback; action geometry represents recorded commands and is not proof of   
arrival. The full interval retains its endpoints, periodic samples, and gripper changes, rather than   
reconstructing unsampled motion or contact forces. See Appendix C for alignment and sampling.

F4 Target-image context   
[GOAL IMAGE G]   
[Input order]

<target image block depicting the desired arrangement>   
<live observation envelope F1>   
<current wrist and overhead image blocks>   
The target image specifies the desired outcome, not a trajectory. It remains distinct from the live   
images used to assess the current arrangement. The instruction for fruit arrangement changes the matching   
attributes to fruit identity, relative position, and spacing.

## D.3 Tool Requests and Feedback

P3 guides tool selection, while P4 governs recovery and termination. F6 illustrates tool requests, and F7 shows the feedback returned for the next decision.

P3 Motion, grasping, and release instructions   
[MODEL TOOL-SELECTION POLICY]   
[Efficient motion and observation boundaries]   
Prefer move\_eef\_chunk for clear, contact-free paths that need no intermediate observation. Do not split   
these paths into many decisions or repeatedly check already-established reachability. Stop to observe at   
contact, gripper changes, occlusion, or tracking anomalies. Efficiency never justifies skipping   
verification.   
For position-only adjustments, keep the last acknowledged target quaternion in the complete pose\_xyzquat.   
Never replace a held orientation with load-induced measured drift; investigate the drift first. A null   
arm retains its submitted targets rather than moving to a new viewing position.   
[Approach and grasp]   
Approach and align, inspect fresh images and state, then call set\_gripper separately. Before closure,   
consider wrist close-ups, the top overview, measured TCP target error, and joint velocity together. A   
submitted target does not prove arrival. Target-versus-measured errors are reported after each action.   
Settled means joint stability, not precise TCP arrival or task success.   
Check fingertips, wrists, camera housings, forearms, and table clearance in fresh views. Do not advance   
contact without verified stabilization and clearance. Keep the acknowledged gripper command during   
transport; issue a separate gripper request when a grasp change is needed.   
[Release and disengagement]   
Before releasing or regrasping, verify that the intended surface or another hand reliably supports the   
entire object. Observe after release and before withdrawing. A fully-open command does not prove that a   
wide object detached.   
If the object stays fixed relative to the fingers or the destination still appears empty, keep it reliably   
supported by the intended surface or container while disengaging the fingers. Do not lift a still-trapped   
object away and report completion.   
[Read execution evidence]   
The planned TCP points describe the planned path, including its start, not a measured trajectory. Judge   
execution from execution feedback and fresh state. Joint torque includes gravity effects and is not a   
direct contact-force measurement. Do not equate a commanded pose, gripper closure, or accepted plan with   
the intended physical result.

F6a Motion and gripper requests   
[OUTPUT a<sub>t</sub> = (u<sub>t</sub>, v<sub>t</sub>)]   
[Move to one absolute TCP target]   
{   
"name": "move\_to",   
"arguments": {   
"target": {   
"left": null,   
"right": {"pose\_xyzquat": [<x>, <y>, <z>, <qx>, <qy>, <qz>, <qw>]}   
},   
"note": "<current evidence and purpose of this motion>"   
}   
}   
The host samples the direct straight-line/SLERP path, applies calibrated frame conversion and IK, and   
adjusts timing. Gripper targets remain unchanged.   
[Move through an ordered sequence]   
{   
"name": "move\_eef\_chunk",   
"arguments": {   
"poses": [   
{"left": null, "right": {"pose\_xyzquat": <first complete pose>}},   
{"left": null, "right": {"pose\_xyzquat": <second complete pose>}}   
],   
"note": "<evidence that this segment needs no intermediate observation>"   
}   
}   
Each pose is absolute and complete. The host preserves every waypoint and its order, adding samples along   
the same path and changing timing rather than rewriting the geometry.   
[Change the gripper in a separate decision]   
{   
"name": "set\_gripper",   
"arguments": {   
"positions": {"left": null, "right": <normalized opening>},   
"note": "<fresh evidence for grasping or releasing>"   
}   
}   
Opening is 0 fully closed and 1 fully open. Results distinguish requested, submitted, and measured   
values. After detected obstruction, the gripper reference is brought near measured position to avoid   
accumulating large error. Arms retain their last submitted targets; an unselected side holds.

## F6b Geometric checks and terminal requests

[ALTERNATIVE TOOL SELECTIONS]   
[Check a path without executing it]   
{   
"name": "check\_path",   
"arguments": {   
"poses": [   
{"left": <complete pose or null>, "right": <complete pose or null>}   
],   
"note": "<uncertain approach or permitted orientation to test>"   
}   
}   
Check full-path IK, joint limits, and timing without sending arm or gripper commands. Acceptance does not   
certify collision clearance or physical tracking; execution replans from fresh feedback.

F6b Geometric checks and terminal requests (continued)   
[Query image geometry]   
{   
"name": "locate\_point",   
"arguments": {   
"camera": "<left, right, or top>",   
"pixel\_xy": [<image x>, <image y>],   
"reference\_step": <earlier observation index>,   
"reference\_pixel\_xy": [<same feature's earlier x>, <earlier y>],   
"note": "<feature identity and reason for geometric query>"   
}   
}   
Pixel origin is the image’s top-left corner. The reference fields are optional; a single view supplies a   
camera ray, not depth. Two wrist views require the same stationary feature and sufficient parallax. Use   
a metric estimate only when metric\_position\_available=true. A triangulation candidate from degenerate   
geometry is diagnostic, not a valid motion target.   
[Finish or report no safe continuation]   
{"name": "done",   
"arguments": {   
"summary": "<direct evidence of the physical goal and any uncertainty>",   
"hindsight": "<lessons from the attempt>"   
}}   
{"name": "give\_up",   
"arguments": {   
"reason": "<attempted strategies and evidence ruling out safe progress>",   
"hindsight": "<lessons from the attempt>"   
}}   
These are alternative responses, not multiple selections in one turn. Completion requires current   
physical evidence; the tool itself does not assign the evaluation success label.

plan describes a request; fresh state and execution feedback establish whether it was tracked. Images   
establish whether the object interaction occurred.   
[Decision context]   
Read a rejection before choosing another target. After execution, compare requested and measured pose,   
gripper command and measured opening, and visible object motion. Settling diagnostics concern joint   
stability; they do not by themselves establish accurate TCP arrival, secure grasping, or task completion.

P4 Recovery and termination instructions   
[NEXT-DECISION POLICY]   
[Recover while preserving the task]   
One failed action, tool rejection, missed grasp, occluded target, or uncertain result does not establish   
impossibility. Diagnose from fresh images, measured state, and previous\_result. Try safe alternatives in   
viewpoint, approach, grasp, orientation, path, or step size and verify each result.   
After IK rejection, preserve required tool-axis directions and compare approach positions, heights, and   
permitted axial rotations. Use check\_path for uncertain alternatives; do not tilt the gripper merely to   
make IK pass. The configured workspace is not a measured reachability boundary: an in-range point may   
still be unreachable at the required orientation. IK acceptance does not certify clearance between camera   
housings, arms, or objects.   
[Verify the physical goal]   
Call done only when fresh observations establish the requested physical outcome. In the summary, give   
direct evidence distinguishing completion from an unfinished state, plus any remaining uncertainty. A   
human assigns the final success/failure label; done itself is not that label.   
For insertion, confirm actual mating and seating, not merely resting on the socket. Do not declare   
completion after withdrawing due to load while the result remains unconfirmed. Continue safe verification   
or recovery while the outcome is uncertain; do not stop early merely to hand the decision to a human.   
[When no safe continuation remains]   
Do not call give\_up while reasonable safe strategies remain. Consider meaningfully different recoveries.   
Use give\_up only when evidence shows that the task cannot be completed or further attempts would violate   
safety constraints. State the attempted strategies and the evidence preventing further progress.

## D.4 Representative Task Prompts

The examples below retain the task-level wording, with asset references replaced by semantic placeholders. They are supplied together with the applicable shared instructions, context, and tool definitions above, rather than used as standalone one-sentence controller prompts. Prepared task specifications and recorded variants are distinguished where relevant.

Cases 1--2 Human demonstration tasks   
[HUMAN VIDEO / F2]   
[Pick Red Towel: demonstration-conditioned task]   
Watch the historical human demonstration frames and imitate the demonstrated grasping method to pick up   
the red towel with the robot’s right hand in the current scene.   
[Pick Red Towel: prepared goal-only comparison]   
Pick up the red towel with the robot’s right hand.   
[Pick Red Towel: recorded procedural variant without video]   
Block the towel with one hand, slide the other hand underneath it, and then grip the towel to lift it.   
[Pick Up Notebook: recorded task]   
Watch the reference video at <notebook demonstration> and pick up the notebook.   
[Associated context]   
The video-conditioned tasks include chronological demonstration image blocks as in F2. The no-video   
variants omit those blocks. The procedural towel variant provides a grasping method in text; it is not   
the same instruction as the prepared goal-only comparison.

## Case 3 Unscrew Bottle Cap

[ROBOT VIDEO OR VIDEO + ACTION / F2–F3]

[Recorded goal without demonstration]

In the current scene, unscrew and remove the cap from the bottle on the table, and leave the bottle standing securely on the table.

[Recorded demonstration-conditioned instruction]

Use the top-view robot demonstration keyframes and corresponding robot states, end-effector poses, and action trajectories in <bottle demonstration> as a reference, adapting the actions to the current observations. In the current scene, unscrew and remove the cap from the bottle on the table, and leave the bottle standing securely on the table.

[Mode-specific reference interpretation]

The recorded task wording mentions numerical references in both conditions. In Video, P2 explicitly restricts the supplied reference to images and annotations. In Video + Action, F3 additionally supplies keyframe states and action samples. Numerical references are therefore available only in Video + Action, not inferred from the task wording.

[Shared instruction applied to this reference]

Preserve the demonstrated contact side, object-to-gripper orientation, push/pull direction, arm roles, and stage order. Identify the relevant stage in each motion note and explain necessary deviations using live evidence. A demonstration’s outcome describes that historical episode only; verify the requested physical result in the current observations.

## Case 4 Remove and Reinsert Plug

[ROBOT VIDEO OR VIDEO + ACTION / F2–F3]

[Recorded Video instruction]

Use the chronological three-view robot demonstration keyframes in <plug video demonstration> as a reference. In the current scene, remove the plug from the power strip on the table, then insert the plug back into the same socket, and leave it fully seated after releasing the gripper.

[Recorded Video + Action instruction]

Use the three-view robot demonstration keyframes and corresponding robot states, end-effector poses, and action trajectories in <plug action demonstration> as a reference, adapting the actions to the current observations. In the current scene, remove the plug from the power strip on the table, then insert the plug back into the same socket, and leave it fully seated after releasing the gripper.

[Additional control guidance: arm choice and clearance]

Choose the arm or arms using fresh views while preserving the demonstrated roles. Use one arm when sufficient, or both when support is needed and clearance allows it. Explain the arm choice in the first motion note. Keep an unused side null so that it retains its acknowledged target. Check camera, wrist, table, and inter-arm clearance; IK feasibility alone does not establish clearance.

[Additional control guidance: orientation and completion]

For a position-only adjustment, hold the acknowledged target quaternion rather than replacing it with measured drift under load. Preserve the required tool direction when comparing approach heights or permitted axial rotations after rejection. When the task requires a table-perpendicular gripper, align tool +z with the table’s downward normal; allow axial rotation only when jaw and contact alignment permit it. Without table calibration, base -z is only a proxy. Verify alignment from the measured TCP pose before advancing contact.

Call set\_gripper separately after observing the approach. Before release, verify reliable support; observe finger disengagement before withdrawal. Do not equate a requested pose or gripper state with the physical result. Confirm actual insertion and seating after release, rather than a plug merely resting on the socket.

## Cases 5--6 Goal-image arrangement tasks

Observe the target image and arrange the blocks on the table into the T shape shown in the image. Match the target image as closely as possible in color, relative position, and spacing.

Each task is paired with its target image and fresh live observations. Shared release instructions require support before opening the gripper and observation before withdrawal. Shared termination instructions require direct evidence of the requested arrangement, rather than merely completing a sequence of placements.

## Cases 7--8 Exploration with self-history

Use the movable exploration history as context. Continue searching for the Sprite bottle on the table by changing the observation position or safely moving obstacles, then grasping it and placing it into the yellow basket containing the strawberry toy once the target is found.

Retained observations, tool requests, and outcomes precede the current observation. This context records what earlier viewpoints revealed and what previous interactions changed. The live state remains the basis for selecting the next tool target.

An occluded target or uncertain result does not establish impossibility. Diagnose from fresh images, measured state, and previous tool feedback, then try safe alternatives in viewpoint, approach, grasp, orientation, path, or step size and verify each result.
